		10.2 No Waiver/Reliance. If you see other parties violating these Terms, we would appreciate it if you would let us know at Info@brandslip.com  (subject line: "TOU Violation").

You may not rely upon Brandslip's precise response with respect to one party or one situation as any indication of what Brandslip might do with respect to another party or another situation, even if the parties or situations appear to you to be similar. Similarly, if we fail to act in response to a violation of these Terms, you should not assume that we do not object to the violation or even that we are aware of it.
